The Working Group on Educational Materials to Support Capacity Building was created in 2022. It is coordinated by WMO staff, leveraging the WMO’s reach and international relationships as the UN’s weather and climate voice. The working group develops, road tests, and disseminates a wide range of multimedia educational and outreach materials and tools with a focus on the needs of least developed countries and small island developing states.
